# Task ID: 9
# Title: Set Up Comprehensive Testing Infrastructure
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: medium
# Description: Establish a complete testing framework with unit tests, integration tests, and coverage reporting to ensure code quality throughout the modernization process.
# Details:
1. Install testing libraries and dependencies:
```bash
npm install --save-dev jest @testing-library/react @testing-library/jest-dom @testing-library/user-event jest-environment-jsdom ts-jest msw jest-coverage-reporter
```

2. Configure Jest for TypeScript support:
   - Create a `jest.config.js` file with appropriate settings:
```javascript
module.exports = {
  preset: 'ts-jest',
  testEnvironment: 'jsdom',
  setupFilesAfterEnv: ['<rootDir>/jest.setup.js'],
  moduleNameMapper: {
    '\\.(css|less|scss|sass)$': 'identity-obj-proxy',
    '^@/(.*)$': '<rootDir>/src/$1'
  },
  collectCoverageFrom: [
    'src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    '!src/**/*.stories.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    '!src/**/*.d.ts'
  ],
  coverageThreshold: {
    global: {
      branches: 70,
      functions: 70,
      lines: 70,
      statements: 70
    }
  }
};
```

3. Create a Jest setup file (`jest.setup.js`):
```javascript
import '@testing-library/jest-dom';
```

4. Set up Mock Service Worker (MSW) for API mocking:
   - Create a `src/mocks` directory
   - Set up handlers and server configuration for simulating API responses

5. Configure integration with Storybook:
   - Install required packages:
   ```bash
   npm install --save-dev @storybook/testing-react @storybook/jest
   ```
   - Create utility functions to import stories into tests

6. Set up GitHub Actions workflow for continuous testing:
   - Create `.github/workflows/test.yml` to run tests on pull requests and main branch commits
   - Configure coverage reporting and PR comments

7. Add npm scripts to package.json:
```json
"scripts": {
  "test": "jest",
  "test:watch": "jest --watch",
  "test:coverage": "jest --coverage",
  "test:ci": "jest --ci --coverage"
}
```

8. Create documentation for testing standards:
   - Document testing patterns and best practices
   - Provide examples for component, hook, and utility testing
   - Define guidelines for test coverage requirements

# Test Strategy:
1. Verify testing environment setup:
   - Run `npm run test` and confirm tests execute without errors
   - Check that TypeScript integration works by writing a simple test with TypeScript syntax
   - Verify coverage reporting generates accurate reports

2. Test the unit testing framework:
   - Create sample unit tests for existing components
   - Verify that DOM testing works correctly with @testing-library/react
   - Confirm that component rendering, user interactions, and state changes can be tested

3. Validate integration testing capabilities:
   - Set up and test API mocking with MSW
   - Create a test that simulates a complete user flow across multiple components
   - Verify that complex interactions can be tested effectively

4. Test coverage reporting:
   - Run `npm run test:coverage` and verify the coverage report is generated
   - Check that the report correctly identifies covered and uncovered code
   - Confirm that coverage thresholds are enforced

5. Verify CI integration:
   - Push a commit to a test branch and confirm that GitHub Actions runs the tests
   - Verify that test failures properly block PR merges
   - Check that coverage reports are correctly attached to PRs

6. Validate Storybook integration:
   - Confirm that components can be imported from Storybook into tests
   - Verify that Storybook stories can be rendered and tested programmatically
