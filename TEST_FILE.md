# Test File

This file is created to test our Git hooks and CI/CD pipeline.

## Testing:

- Pre-commit hooks (Prettier formatting)
- Commit message validation
- GitHub Actions workflows
- Automated deployment

This line is intentionally long to test if Prettier will wrap it according to our configuration settings that we defined in the .prettierrc.json file.

TODO: This TODO comment will be detected by our code quality workflow.

console.log('This console statement should be detected');
